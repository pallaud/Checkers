Checkers 


This project implements a 2-player version of checkers with a functional chat box that can be played on 2 different computers. We use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to establish and maintain a network conversation that allows application programs to exchange data. Using ports and sockets, we estalish a connection between 2 different computers on which 2 opponents are playing the checkers game, and allow the players to communicate with each other. The moves made by each player are reflected on the others' screen, and the chat box feature is an additional experimentation with networking.

For a full description of the various elements of this code, see the final specification.
